# Multi-Agent Research Systems

## Overview
Multi-agent research systems represent a paradigm shift in how we approach complex information gathering and analysis. These systems leverage multiple specialized AI agents working collaboratively to provide comprehensive research insights.

## Key Benefits

### 1. Specialized Expertise
Each agent focuses on specific tasks:
- **Orchestrator**: Plans and coordinates research strategy
- **Researcher**: Executes information gathering using various tools
- **Critic**: Reviews findings for accuracy and completeness  
- **Synthesizer**: Produces final polished answers

### 2. Quality Assurance
The multi-stage process ensures:
- Fact-checking and verification
- Citation validation
- Bias detection
- Completeness assessment

### 3. Scalability
Systems can handle:
- Multiple concurrent research queries
- Large document collections
- Complex multi-step analyses
- Real-time information updates

## Use Cases

### Academic Research
- Literature reviews
- Citation analysis
- Hypothesis validation
- Data synthesis

### Business Intelligence
- Market research
- Competitor analysis
- Trend identification
- Risk assessment

### Technical Documentation
- API documentation analysis
- Code review assistance
- Architecture planning
- Best practice identification

## Technical Architecture

The system uses a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** approach combining:
- Vector databases for semantic search
- LLM chains for reasoning and synthesis
- Tool integration for external data access
- State management for workflow coordination

ChromaDB serves as the vector store providing:
- Efficient similarity search
- Metadata filtering
